# **Housing Price Prediction**
***
Notebook to predict the price of houses, using a USA housing dataset.


### Summary
The aim of this project is to predict house prices using one basic machine learning algorithms such Linear Regression and LCS, and **advanced algorithms** like: Random Forest, SVM, XGBOOST. We will also use regression and statistics tool in our analysis to understand the information with in the dataset. For exploration and analysis univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistics are performed.

### Results
Random Forest was found to be the better model for predicting house prices. It out performed the regession algorithms with performance accuracy of 85% using R-squared metric. The most important predictor was the overall quality of a house, following the size of above ground living area and the total basement square footage. This project is a first pass to get us quickly to a reasonable good model prototype.
